          <h1>Reflections of a Not-Quite-First-Rate Writer</h1>
          <h2>
            Every once in a while&mdash;really every other day&mdash;I&apos;m
            afflicted with a suddenly entrenched and blistering feeling of
            incompetence of the literary variety. Frustration boils over to a
            point of intellectual dormancy, and my mind is rendered out of
            sorts.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            In my mind&apos;s eye there is a writer, reader and perpetual
            student less indicisive, insecure and scatterbrained than I. She
            remains tenaciously tunnel focussed, intellectually robust and
            experienced, yet contrasts the routinized humdrum of my life with an
            existence so sweetly adorned with a sort of musical quality it's
            almost tragic; tuned perfectly, beautifully, to something akin to a
            Bill Evans piece. Remaining for the most part in the recesses of my
            mind, she silently emerges in full form at these sordid moments of
            painfully abject insecurity, reminding me of all my rough edges, my
            flimsiness and my inexperience. In a fit of irrationality bordering
            on the imbecilic, I allow my despondency&mdash;and what I consider
            to be her undeniable supremacy over me&mdash;to stutter my
            progression, even imperceptibly so (but disrupt nevertheless).
          </h2>
          <h2>
            I regard my skepticism to be in some ways a weakness of my being. I
            presume that it is a reflexive mechanism I have developed in
            response to what I commonly percieve to be the paralyzing,
            ubiquitous fog of dogmatism. I wish not to transform this habitual
            response into anything approximating a vain contrarianism, or into
            aimless theatrics of conjecture. It&apos;s not so much that I am a
            harshly judgemental person as I am an ever critical one (many a time
            to my own detriment); subject to much of this critique being those
            positions and modalities that can best be described as status quo.
            Another common subject of my criticisms is of course myself. But I
            don't wish to write much of my person, not explicitly at least.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            In <i>Notes of a Native Son</i>, Baldwin writes: "One writes out of
            one thing only&mdash;one&apos;s own experience. Everything depends
            on how relentlessly one forces from this experience the last drop,
            sweet or bitter, it can possibly give. This is the only real concern
            of the artist, to recreate out of the disorder of life that order
            which is art." I became increasingly prepared as time passed, to do
            the work of persistently forcing whatever it is from my experiences
            that a good writer ought to use, but I&apos;m afraid that despite
            this readiness, my experiences turned out to have been somewhat
            banal. How does one remedy a lack of experience (or good
            experience?), which is, really, a lack of knowledge? I suppose I
            took to reading to solve this very dilemma, and a defining theme of
            my life appears to have thus, over the years, become one of
            perpetual renovation; mainly renovations, and reconstructions, of
            intellect and soul. My ever expanding list of literary, scholarly,
            and journalistic reads ensures my commitment, in effect, to this
            life of perpetual renovation, as does the aforementioned skepticism
            constantly presiding over my thoughts. I reflect upon these
            observations and I think: this is presumably part and parcel of what
            Baldwin described as the kinetic, potential-filled disorder of the
            writer's life. And I'm certainly a little relieved for that.

            Writing a full-fledged memoir or autobiography is perhaps above my
            age-grade, so I should refrain from babbling on any longer. Thank
            you for paying my thoughts a visit and, please, feel free reach out
            to me via email if you would like.
