          <h1>Reflections of a Not-Quite-First-Rate Writer</h1>
          <h2>
            Every once in a while –really every other day– I'm afflicted with a
            suddenly entrenched and blistering feeling of incompetence of the
            literary variety. Frustration boils over to a point of intellectual
            dormancy, and my mind is rendered out of sorts.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            In my mind's eye there is a writer, reader and perpetual student
            less indicisive, insecure and scatterbrained than I. She remains
            unyieldingly tunnel focussed, intellectually robust and experienced,
            yet contrasts the routinized humdrum of my life with an existence so
            sweetly adorned with a sort of musical quality it's almost tragic;
            tuned perfectly, beautifully, to something akin to a Bill Evans
            piece. Remaining for the most part in the recesses of my mind, she
            silently emerges in full form at these most sordid moments of
            painfully abject insecurity, reminding me of all my rough edges, my
            flimsiness and inexperience. So, in a fit of irrationality bordering
            on the imbecilic, I allow my despondency –and what I consider to be
            her to undeniable supremacy over me– to imperceptibly stutter (but
            nonetheless disrupt) my progression.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            I regard my skepticism to be in some ways a weakness of my being.
            It's not so much that I am an harshly judgemental person as I am an
            overly critical one; subject to much of this critique being those
            positions and modalities that can best be described as status quo.
