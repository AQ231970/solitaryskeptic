          <h2>
            Every once in a while&mdash;really every other day&mdash;I&apos;m
            afflicted with a suddenly entrenched and blistering feeling of
            incompetence of the literary variety. Frustration boils over to a
            point of intellectual dormancy, and my mind is rendered out of
            sorts.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            In my mind&apos;s eye there is a writer, reader and perpetual
            student less indecisive, insecure and scatterbrained than I. She
            remains tenaciously tunnel focused, intellectually robust and
            experienced, yet contrasts the routinized humdrum of my life with an
            existence so sweetly adorned with a sort of musical quality it's
            almost tragic; tuned perfectly, beautifully, to something akin to a
            Bill Evans piece. Remaining for the most part in the recesses of my
            mind, she silently emerges in full form at these sordid moments of
            painfully abject insecurity, reminding me of all my rough edges, my
            flimsiness and my inexperience. In a fit of confoundedness bordering
            on the imbecilic, I allow my despondency&mdash;and what I consider
            to be her undeniable supremacy over me&mdash;to (ever imperceptibly)
            stutter my progression.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            I regard my skepticism to be in some ways a weakness of my being. I
            presume that it is a reflexive mechanism I have developed in
            response to what I commonly perceive to be the paralyzing,
            ubiquitous fog of dogmatism. I wish to not transform this habitual
            response into anything approximating a vain contrarianism, or into
            aimless theatrics of conjecture. It&apos;s not so much that I am a
            harshly judgmental person as I am an ever critical one (many a time
            to my own chagrin); subject to much of this critique being those
            positions and modalities that can best be described as status quo.
            Another common subject of my criticisms is of course myself. But I
            don&apos;t wish to write much of my person, not explicitly at least.
          </h2>
          <h2>
            In his 1955 essay collection, <i>Notes of a Native Son,</i> Baldwin
            writes: "One writes out of one thing only&mdash;one&apos;s own
            experience. Everything depends on how relentlessly one forces from
            this experience the last drop, sweet or bitter, it can possibly
            give. This is the only real concern of the artist, to recreate out
            of the disorder of life that order which is art." I became
            increasingly prepared as time passed, to do the work of persistently
            forcing whatever it is from my experiences that a good writer ought
            to use, but I&apos;m afraid that despite this readiness, my
            experiences turned out to have been somewhat banal. How does one
            remedy a lack of experiences (or good experiences?), which is,
            really, a lack of knowledge? I suppose I took to reading to solve
            this very dilemma, and a defining theme of my life since appears to
            have become one of perpetual renovation; mainly renovations, and
            reconstructions, of the intellectual sort. My ever expanding list of
            literary, scholarly, and journalistic reads ensures my commitment,
            in effect, to this life of perpetual renovation, as does the
            aforementioned skepticism constantly presiding over my thoughts. I
            reflect upon these observations and I think: this is possibly part
            and parcel of what Baldwin described as the kinetic,
            potential-filled disorder of the writer's life. And I'm certainly a
            little relieved for that.

            Writing a full-fledged autobiography is perhaps above my age
            bracket, so I should refrain from prattling on any longer. Thank you
            for paying my thoughts a visit and, please, feel free reach out to
            me via email if you would like.
